[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)'s Remote API network layer module.

`docker-modem` will help you talking with `Docker`, since it already implements all the network strategies needed to support all `Docker`'s Remote API endpoints.

It is the module powering (network wise) [dockerode](https://github.com/apocas/dockerode) and other modules.

## Tests

Tests are implemented using `mocha` and `chai`. Run them with `npm test`.
